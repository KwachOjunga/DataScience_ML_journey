 Treading the ML journey
 ---

 This repository explores my Machine learning journey exploring various algorithms such as:
  - DecisionTrees
    - Third revision outdid the first model **titaninc_EDA.ipynb** by a slight margin :smile:
    - Fourth revision using random forests and voting classifier has outdone the previous ones though still below the bar
  - Random forests
    - Still uncertain how these work though.
  - KNearest Neighbours
  - Linear Regression 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - PCA
  - Perceptron
  - SVM

Let's see what awaits :satisfied:
